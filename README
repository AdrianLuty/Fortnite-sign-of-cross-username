It's important to note that this name doesn't affect gameplay or provide any benefits, it is just for your fun and curiosity. 
Epic Games may change this name at any time so that it no longer appears as a crosshair within game as Xbox has already done.
Its use can only be seen on PC using the Epic Games launcher, since platforms like Xbox don't allow these special characters. 
Remember that once the name is changed, it remains in place for two weeks and cannot be changed again. Use at your own risk.
